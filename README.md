# Bitcoin-Ripple-Price-Notification

The price of cryptocurrency keeps on fluctuating. It is difficult to open an app every now and then to check the current price.

-->This app will notify the user of the current price by sending messages on its Telegram app.

-->It shall also send a phone notification if the price of the btc falls below a threshold value or the price of xrp rises over a desired value, so that the currency can be bought or sold.

-->It makes use of IFTTT to connect to the phone notifications and apps.
